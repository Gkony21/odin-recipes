    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Saganaki</strong> is a showstopper at many Greek restaurants, where it often arrives 
        at your table still sizzling in the skillet. The next step <br> is rather dramatic,
         as the server proceeds to light it on fire, with the help of ouzo, just before serving.
          This last step in its presentation <br> is what gives it the name “flaming Greek saganaki.”

    </p>

    <p>
        In this <strong>saganaki recipe</strong>, the table side show is totally optional but surprisingly easy to accomplish!
        I know this festive dish—the savory <br>version of our beloved feta, honey, and sesame saganaki—will 
        quickly become the top request at your dinner parties. If you love melted <br> Greek cheese as much as
         I do, you may want to try them both!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Spirit (optional)<i>

    </ul><br>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the cheese. Slice a (cold) 8-ounce block of cheese into two 1/2-inch wide pieces.
             Briefly run it under room temperature water and pat dry. </li><br>

        <li>Coat the cheese in flour. Spread all purpose flour onto a rimmed plate and season with black
             pepper. Dredge each half in the flour and pepper mixture,<br> shaking off any excess.</li><br>

        <li>Pan-fry the cheese. Add 1/4 cup of olive oil to a medium nonstick skillet. Set over medium heat. 
            When the oil is hot (but not smoking), pan-sear the <br>cheese slices until they’re golden brown and bubbling
             on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. The cheese should form a nice thin crust with a soft, melty interior.</li><br>
        
        <li>Serve: Squeeze on some lemon juice and serve the fried Greek cheese immediately. Or, flambé the cheese with the 
            help of brandy or ouzo (see instructions below).</li>

    </ol><br>
