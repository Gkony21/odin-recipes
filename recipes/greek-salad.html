        In Greece, <strong>Horiatiki or Greek village salad</strong>, is served most often from early spring through summer and up until mid fall.It’s 
        truly the best use of the season’s produce, like crunchy cucumbers, sweet tomatoes, and earthy green bell peppers.I know you’ll

    <h3 class="small-title">Steps</h3> 

    <ol>
        <li>Shock the onion (optional). Halve and thinly slice one red onion into half moons.
             If you’d like to mellow its raw taste, fill a small bowl with ice water.
             Add about 1 teaspoon of red wine vinegar to the water, then add the onion slices. 
             Set aside to soak for 10 minutes or so while you prep the veggies.</li> <br>
        
        <li>Prep the veggies. Slice 4 medium tomatoes into bite-sized pieces. 
            Partially peel a cucumber into a stripe pattern, then slice into half moons. 
            Slice 1 green bell pepper into rings.</li> <br>

        <li>Season. Place all the veggies in a large serving dish, along with a handful 
            of pitted Kalamata olives. Remove the onions  from the ice water and add to the 
            platter with the rest of the veggies. Sprinkle on 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried oregano
             and a pinch of kosher salt. </li> <br>

        <li>Dress. Pour in 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil and 1-2 tablespoons of red wine
             vinegar. Give everything a very gentle toss. </li> <br>

        <li>Finish and serve. Break off or slice large pieces of feta and add to the top of the salad.
             Finish with a final sprinkle of 1/4 tablespoon of oregano. Enjoy!</li> <br>

    </ol>
