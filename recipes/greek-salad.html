    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This <strong>Greek salad</strong> recipe is a prime example of a simple salad that lets crunchy vegetables shine with no lettuce or other filler. <br>
         Like Bulgarian Shopska or Italian Caprese,the classic table salad uses just a few humble ingredients, yet has become a totally 
         <br> iconic dish that’s beloved around the world. 
    </p>

 

    <p>

        In Greece, <strong>Horiatiki or Greek village salad</strong>, is served most often from early spring through summer and up until mid fall. <br> It’s 
        truly the best use of the season’s produce, like crunchy cucumbers, sweet tomatoes, and earthy green bell peppers. <br>I know you’ll
         love it as much as I do.

    </p> <br>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    
    <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Olives</li>

        <li>Feta cheese</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3>Steps</h3> 

    <ol>
        <li>Shock the onion (optional). Halve and thinly slice one red onion into half moons.
             If you’d like to mellow its raw taste, <br>fill a small bowl with ice water.
             Add about 1 teaspoon of red wine vinegar to the water, then add the onion slices. 
             <br>Set aside to soak for 10 minutes or so while you prep the veggies.</li> <br>
        
        <li>Prep the veggies. Slice 4 medium tomatoes into bite-sized pieces. 
            Partially peel a cucumber into a stripe pattern, <br> then slice into half moons. 
            Slice 1 green bell pepper into rings.</li> <br>

        <li>Season. Place all the veggies in a large serving dish, along with a handful 
            of pitted Kalamata olives. Remove the onions <br> from the ice water and add to the 
            platter with the rest of the veggies. Sprinkle on 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried oregano
             and <br>a pinch of kosher salt. </li> <br>

        <li>Dress. Pour in 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil and 1-2 tablespoons of red wine
             vinegar. Give everything a very gentle toss. </li> <br>

        <li>Finish and serve. Break off or slice large pieces of feta and add to the top of the salad.
             Finish with a final sprinkle of 1/4 <br>tablespoon of oregano. Enjoy!</li> <br>

    </ol>
