        that’s sometimes flavored with rose water,to Indian kheer scented with cardamom and saffron, to Sicilian 
        Strawberry Pudding, to French riz au lait that’s often finished with heavy whipping cream.

    <div class="list1">
    <ul class="ul1">
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Lemon and orange</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Sugar<i>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>

    </ul></div>

    <h3 class="small-title">Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Season the milk. In a medium saucepan, add 4 1/4 cups milk, 1/2 cup Arborio rice, 1 cinnamon 
            stick, a 2-inch strip of lemon rind, and the zest <br>from 1/4 orange. Use a small knife to split the 
            vanilla pod in half lengthwise, then scrape the seeds into the pan and discard the pod<br> (wait until
             later if you’re using vanilla extract). </li><br>

        <li>Bring to a simmer. Bring the mixture to a simmer over low to medium heat, whisking continuously
             for the first 3 minutes so that the milk <br> and rice do not stick to the bottom of the pot. </li><br>

        <li>Cook rice. Continue to cook rice, whisking vigorously every six or so minutes and until the rice is
             very tender and the mixture has started to thicken. <br> This should take about 35-40 minutes. To check 
             if the rice is cooked, taste a rice grain. It should be very soft. The consistency of the milk should <br>
             be thick like heavy cream. </li><br>
        
        <li>Thicken. Dilute 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 1/4 cup of water in a small bowl. Pour into the rice
             mixture over low heat, whisking until combined <br> and the pudding has thickened yet is slightly pourable
              in consistency. This will happen quickly, so keep an eye on it. Remove from heat.  It will <br>continue to
               thicken slightly while it cools, so do not make it too thick. </li><br>

        <li>Finish. Remove and discard the lemon rind and cinnamon stick. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 
            sweeten to taste (I like about 2 tablespoons of sugar to start).</li><br>

        <li>Serve. Pour the pudding into 5 serving bowls and liberally sprinkle with cinnamon powder.</li>

    </ol><br>
